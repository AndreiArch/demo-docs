**Bypass the security warning**

1. Open these URLs directly in your browser:

- \< a href = "<a href="https://localhost:3030" target="_blank">https\://localhost:3030</a>" target = "\_blank" > https\://localhost:3030 \</ a >
- \< a href = "[https://localhost:8642](https://localhost:8642)" target = "\_blank" > https\://localhost:8642 \</ a >

1. A **"Your connection is not private"** warning appears.
2. Click **Advanced** → **Proceed to localhost (unsafe)**.
3. Reload the engine’s website.
